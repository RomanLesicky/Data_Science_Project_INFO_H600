# Data_Science_Project_INFO_H600

### Project Overview:

This project involves implementing a data processing pipeline to analyze music playlists. The primary objective is to address the "playlist continuation" challenge which is about predicting which tracks fit best with a playlist given a playlist name and a few tracks

THe data that we are meant to do this from is tje infamous Million Playlist Dataset (available on Kaggle 32.1 GB of playlist). 

This project consists of 5 tasks:

1. Big Data Strategy: Describe the approach for handling the 35 GB dataset and discuss considered alternatives. Ideally, the solution should scale to the whole dataset, though processing all of it is not strictly expected.

2. Statistics: Present interesting statistical or aggregate information derived from the dataset.

3. Track Similarity: Propose and implement a method to compute a similarity score (0 to 1) between two tracks.

4. Playlist Similarity: Propose and implement a method to compute a similarity score (0 to 1) between two playlists.

5. Playlist Continuation: Propose and implement a method to solve the playlist continuation challenge
